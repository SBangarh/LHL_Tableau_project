# GENERAL THOUGHTS DELETE BEFORE FINAL SUBMISSION!!1
##
Overall concept is to explore damage - who, what, where, when, how, cost etc
So what percentage of collisions cause damage - pi chart
what time of day do collisions happen, pahse of flight and by aircraft type

which animals cause the most damage by category and order - broken into amount of damage(effect)

Story idea: show absolute values and percentages too
    What is the airport distribution like
    what % of collisions cause damage
    what is the impact of the collisions that cause damage - work in time of day and aircraft
    what animal orders are responsible for the most hits, what % cause damage by time of day and flight impact

# Final-Project-Tableau

## Project/Goals
1. My overall goal is to use Tableau and wildlife collision data from the FAA to understand the impact of damage caused by wildlife as well as perform a forecast

## Process
### (your step 1)
### (your step 2)

## Results
(Fill in which Option you chose, either 1 or 2. List the dataset you selected for the project if you selected Option 2. Also, discuss the visualizations you created, and why. For Option 2, also identify what your data question was, and how you went through the prompts.)

## Challenges 
(discuss challenges you faced in the project)

## Future Goals
(what would you do if you had more time?)
